 
Objective 
The objective is to demonstrate pushing changes to a GitHub repository, covering setup, managing 
visibility, and executing basic Git operations. 
Tools/ Software Required 
• Git (Version Control System) 
• GitHub Account 
• Code Editor (VS Code / Sublime / Notepad++) 
• Command Line Interface (Terminal / Git Bash) 
Industry Relevance and Applications 
• Software Development: Enables version control for large codebases. 
• Collaboration: Supports team-based projects using GitHub. 
• DevOps: Integral for CI/CD pipelines and automation workflows. 
• Open Source Contribution: Used for managing public repositories and contributions. 
Description 
The aim of the experiment is to demonstrate the process of pushing changes to a GitHub repository. 
This involves: 
1. Setting up Git: Ensure Git is installed on your computer. 
2. Managing Repository Visibility: Understand the effects of making a repository private or 
public on GitHub. 
3. Changing Repository Visibility: Learn how to change the visibility of a repository on GitHub. 
4. Pushing Changes to the Repository: Make changes to a local repository, commit them, and 
push them to the remote repository on GitHub. 
Introduction of GIT 
Git is one of the ways of implementing the idea of version control. It is Distributed Version Control 
System. 
Managing Private and Public Repository 
Making a repository Private 
• GitHub will detach public forks of the public repository and put them into a new network. Public 
forks are not made private. 
• If you’re using GitHub Free for personal accounts or organizations, some features won’t be 
available in the repository after you change the visibility to private. Any published GitHub Pages 
site will be automatically unpublished. If you added a custom domain to the GitHub Pages site, 
you should remove or update your DNS records before making the repository private, to avoid the 
risk of a domain takeover.

• GitHub will no longer include the repository in the GitHub Archive Program. 
• GitHub Advanced Security features, such as code scanning, will stop working. 
Making a repository Public 
• GitHub will detach private forks and turn them into a standalone private repository. 
• If you’re converting your private repository to a public repository as part of a move toward creating 
an open source project. 
• Once your repository is public, you can also view your repository’s community profile to see 
whether your project meets best practices for supporting contributors. 
• The repository will automatically gain access to GitHub Advanced Security features. 
Changing a repository’s Visibility 
1. On GitHub.com, navigate to the main page of the repository. 
2. Under your repository name, click Settings. If you cannot see the ‘Settings’ tab, select the 
dropdown menu, then click Settings. 
3. In the ‘Danger Zone’ section, click Change visibility.  
4. Select a visibility. 
5. To verify that you’re changing the correct repository’s visibility, type the name of the repository 
you want to change the visibility of. 
6. Click I understand, change repository visibility. 
Command list with explanation: 
git init : Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory. 
git add . : Stages all changes (files) for the next commit. 
git commit -m "message" : Commits the staged changes with a message. 
git remote add origin <repo-link> : Links the local repository to a remote GitHub repository. 
git remote –v : Displays the remote connections. 
git push -u origin main : Pushes committed changes to the main branch of the remote repo. 
git pull origin main : Fetches and merges changes from the remote repository into local. 
Procedure 
1. Pushing Changes to the Repository: 
1. Create a new repository in github 
2. Open terminal in your project folder. 
3. Initialize Git: use the command ‘git init’ to make the folder a Git repository. 
4. Add files: git add . to stage all changes. 
5. Commit changes: git commit -m "your message" to save the changes locally. 
6. Connect remote repo: git remote add origin <repo-link> to link GitHub repository. 
7. Check remote: git remote -v to confirm the remote link. 
8. Push changes: git push -u origin main to upload to the main branch. 
 
2. Perform Pull Request and Merge: 
1. Create a New Branch From your local repository using: git checkout -b feature-branch 
2. Make Changes in the Branch 
• Edit or add files in your project folder.

• Stage and commit the changes, using: git add . and git commit -m "Added new feature"  
3. Push the new branch to the remote repository using: git push origin feature-branch 
4. Create a Pull Request on GitHub 
• Go to your repository on GitHub. 
• You’ll see a prompt: Compare & pull request → Click it. 
• Check the base branch (main) and compare branch (feature-branch). 
• Add a title and description. 
• Click Create pull request. 
5. Merge the Pull Request 
• After reviewing, click Merge pull request. 
• Confirm by clicking Confirm merge. 
• Delete the feature branch. 
3. Managing Repository Visibility: 
1. Log in to GitHub and navigate to the repository you want to modify. 
2. Click on the Settings tab. 
 
3. Scroll down to the Danger Zone section. 
 
4. Click Change Visibility. 
5. Select the desired option: 
• Make private → Restricts visibility to you and collaborators. 
• Make public → Allows anyone to view your repository. 
6. Confirm the action: 
• Type the repository name in the confirmation box. 
• Click I understand, change repository visibility.
